# Sew's custom Dev Container Images

Be aware, Docker images created here have the same tags as the official ones,
so to use these custom images you have to locally build all required images
(base too). Build commands are added to READMEs.

The dev-container definitions in `.devcontainer` directory are only for local
testing and are quite neglected. Use `.devcontainer.json` files from `src`
to create your dev-containers.
